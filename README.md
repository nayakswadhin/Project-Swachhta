# Office Cleanliness Monitoring System 🚮✨

This project focuses on monitoring the cleanliness of office spaces using AI-powered image processing technology. The system leverages a camera installed inside the office to capture images, analyzes them using a machine learning model to detect waste, and generates a cleanliness score. The score can be compared with previous data to track cleanliness trends and improvements over time.

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered Waste Detection**: Detects waste present in the room based on captured images.
- **Cleanliness Score**: Calculates a cleanliness score for the office based on the model's output.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares current cleanliness scores with historical data to identify trends.
- **Power BI Integration**: Visualizes data using Power BI graphs for detailed analysis and insights.
- **Dashboard Overview**: Provides an intuitive dashboard displaying the cleanliness metrics and trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, YOLOv5
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Image Capture**: A camera installed inside the office captures images of the space at regular intervals.
2. **AI Analysis**: The images are processed by an AI model to detect waste items and assess the room's cleanliness.
3. **Score Generation**: The system generates a cleanliness score and stores it for trend analysis.
4. **Visualization**: Power BI graphs display historical data, trends, and insights for easy monitoring.
